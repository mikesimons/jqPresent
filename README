jqPresent - A jQuery presentation plugin
========================================

jqPresent is a jQuery plugin for giving presentations via your web browser.

Requirements
------------
All of the requirements are bundled in this repo but if you wish to just use the plugin script (scripts/jqPresent.js) then you will need jQuery and jQuery.hotkeys.

Intended usage
--------------
Fork this repo, edit index.html to suit your content, commit, present.

Current features
----------------
* Per slide transition (see index.html)
* Incremental points with per point transitions (see index.html)
* Slides can contain anything a normal webpage can including HTML5 video, canvas tags etc (however, to keep it slick I recommend putting these in a lightbox)
* Keyboard navigation
* Automatically generated pager
* Next / prev links
* 'Visited' slides concept

'Visited' slides are slides that have been entered and have had all points on them exposed. When viewing a 'visited' slide, the points are all visible and are ignored for the forward / backward actions. If you need to make a lside un-'visited' then you must reset it with CTRL+X.

Keys
----

* __UP__     - Previous slide
* __DOWN__   - Next slide 
* __LEFT__   - Go backward (will hide previous point or flip to previous slide of no points left)
* __RIGHT__  - Go forward (will show next point or flip to next slide if no points left)
* __CTRL+X__ - Reset slide
* __CTRL+SHIFT+X__ - Reset presentation

Roadmap
-------
0.2

* Per slide events (will allow you to bind JS to slide entry / exit and point show / hide)
* Code highlighting http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/wiki/Overview
* Presentation mode (Hides relnav and pager)

0.3

* Print mode (to allow you to print to PDF and upload to slideshare et.al)
* Overlay / non-visible point support (To point out specific aspects of a slide)
